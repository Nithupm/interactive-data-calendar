It displays events on a calendar and shows a bar chart with data when a date is selected.

-Highlight the selected date
-Show a bar chart in a popup when a date is clicked
-If no data exists for a date, show a warning message
-State management with Redux Toolkit
-Dummy JSON data used for testing

   git clone https://github.com/Nithupm/interactive-data-calendar.git
   cd interactive-data-calendar

2.Install dependencies: npm install
